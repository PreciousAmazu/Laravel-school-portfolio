                <div class="text">
                    <p>One of my greatest motivations in ICT would be that a degree in HBO-ICT can get me a job in technology I'll have amazing travel opportunities and also the fact that I love the creativity and imagination involved. The ICT study will also help me achieve my dream of being a software engineer.
                        I have always loved computers and also the challenge Programming brings.
                        Working as an ICT professional I need to create the solutions to problems and adapt them to fix individual cases. Having a three months course on html, css, JavaScript and bootstrap also got me really involved in this and also helped me make a decision on my choice of study.
                    </p>
                    <p>Wait! I did forget to mention, in order to get a job i need to improve certain skills and
                        HBO-ICT does that for me. The following skills should be improved;</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Knowledge on Programming</li>
                        <li>Professional Skills</li>
